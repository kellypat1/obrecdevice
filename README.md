# obrecdevice
Program to find the optimal dimensions of an OBREC device that maximize the produced energy.

The hydrodynamic problem is solved using an analytic model developed in Python.

The program provide results for four different wave overtopping discharge models(Owen model, Hedges and Reis model , Kofoed model and Van der Meer model). 

The proposed program is performed in port of Foiniki in Karpathos. In order to change the port change the numbers in lines #9, #10, #11, #13.
